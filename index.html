          Hi my name is Asif Kabir. My family is from Bangladesh but I lived in Georgia my whole life. I have two younger siblings.
          One of them is attending Georgia State University and is majoring in journalism. The other one has already graduated
          and is working at a Hospital. We also have a dog name Courage.

        I graduated from Mill Creek High School in 2009. I then attended Georgia Gwinnett College and pursed a degree in Business
        Administration. I worked as a mortgage loan originator for one year. After that, I decided to go to grad school and
        pursue a Master's in Business Administration. Once I graduated, I became a loan originator again. After some time,
        I decided to change my career and that is why I am here.

        My hobbies are working out, hiking, hanging out friends and sometimes reading books. My favorite movie is the Rocky film
        series. My favorite novel of all time is Phantoms which is written by Dean Koontz. I usually read all genre of books
        except romance. I also don't read the same book twice.
